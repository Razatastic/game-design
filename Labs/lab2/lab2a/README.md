# 1 - Images and Pixels (2 points)
## 1.1 - Go through the Processing tutorial on Images and Pixels
#### http://www.processing.org/learning/pixels/
## 1.2 - Visit the NSKY web site
#### http://nskyc.com/
## 1.3 - Compute average color
Create a program in Processing that loads an image and computes the average color over all the pixels in the image. Create a second image where all the pixels are set to the average color (like on NSKY!). Have the program display the original image first, and then when the user presses any key or clicks the mouse, show the averaged image. Have the program toggle between the original image and the averaged image.

## 1.4 - Add keyboard input support
Modify your program so that it can behave differently based on different inputs by the user. For example, if the user presses A or a, show the averaged image; if the user presses B or b, show the original image tinted blue; if the user presses G or g, show the original image tinted green; if the user presses R or r, show the original image tinted red; if the user presses Y or y, show the original image tinted yellow; and if the user presses O or o, show the original image again. 
###### HINT: Use the tint() function. (1 point this part)
