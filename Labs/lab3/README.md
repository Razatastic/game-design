## CISC 3665, Fall 2018

## Lab 3

# Instructions

Using loop(s), createinteractivepatterns of shapes/objects. You can make them change size, position, shape,
and so on as they iterate.

Gamify your display with a score and win and lose conditions.

This is a very open-ended assignment. You have to figure out what you want to do and how to turn that into a
game. You must include at least two elements of fun (of the eight that we discussed in class). Document which
types of fun your game has, and how it achieves them, BOTH in a comment at the heading of your code and in
the comment box of your Blackboard submission.

Name your file FirstNameLastNameLab3 (e.g. JohnSmithLab3).

This assignment is due on Tuesday, October 9 at 11:59 PM.

To submit this assignment:

- Post the code on OpenProcessing
- Submit your code file through the Blackboard link here. Zip them if there is more than one.
- Insert a comment in your Blackboard submission with a) the URL to your OpenProcessing submission and
  b) your two types of fun.

Remember not to modify your code on OpenProcessing once the deadline has passed!

This assignment is worth 5 points:

- 3 points for satisfying the assignment constraints (i.e. doing what I told you do)
- 1 point for a clear explanation of the types of fun. (Note that if your game is not fun, this may also cause
  a deduction of points for not satisfying constraints.)
- 1 point for creativity and balance and overall creating a nice game
